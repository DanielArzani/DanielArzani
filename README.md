## üí´About Me

I am a highly motivated front-end web developer with a strong emphasis on accessibility. With over 800 commits to GitHub in the past year, I am dedicated to coding for 10 hours a day, 5 days a week.

 I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, SASS, and familiar with full-stack development and command line tools. I have experience in developing accessible HTML through various technologies and feedback from other developers, and expertise in creating scalable, well-organized, and clean CSS using the CUBE methodology and BEM naming convention. 

I am always looking to improve my skills and am dedicated to staying up to date with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun Fact

- When you purchase packaged lettuce, you‚Äôre usually paying around 2.5x the price for 1/4
  the amount of lettuce you would get if you bought it raw. (If you want more lettuce for less,
  you know what to do now)
