## üí´About Me

As a front-end web developer, I am passionate about creating accessible and user-friendly web experiences. With a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and SASS, I am well-equipped to handle a variety of web development projects. 

Over the past year, I have made over 800 commits to GitHub and consistently commit 8 hours a day, 5 days a week to coding. I possess expertise in creating scalable, well-organized, and clean CSS using the CUBE methodology and BEM naming convention, and have experience in developing accessible HTML through various technologies and feedback from other developers. In addition, I am familiar with full-stack development and command line tools. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the industry, and am always looking for ways to improve my skills.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun Fact

  the amount of lettuce you would get if you bought it raw. (If you want more lettuce for less,
  you know what to do now)
