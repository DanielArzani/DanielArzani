## üí´About Me

I originally took a Udemy course to see if I liked Web Development - and well, I did!

I went for a full stack bootcamp as the next thing I did. This might hold true for most bootcamps but they ended up focusing mostly on the server side.

I realized this acutely when I still had trouble with the frontend even after my 6 months were over.

What did I do then? I signed up for frontend mentor and began practising using the foundational technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I signed up for a pro-subscription in order to receive the design files for the projects and as I built more and more I could see how deep the frontend was, as I submitted my work for peer review and was told over and over again about how accessibility is what ties the 3 technologies together I saw my entire way of coding changing.

I learned exactly which professionals' works I should read and what each component required in order to meet WCAG 2.1 standards.

I went from there to using SASS and CUBE CSS methodology, using either typescript or JSdocs + VS code's build-in typechecker for type-checking and after that testing, simply so I could improve my understanding of programming (and of course for the safety they provide)

What about now? As I move through these projects, I've made a small checklist about what technologies to use for them, because in the end these are all tools and the right tool should be used for the right job.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Fun Fact

- When you purchase packaged lettuce, you‚Äôre usually paying around 2.5x the price for 1/4
  the amount of lettuce you would get if you bought it raw. (If you want more lettuce for less,
  you know what to do now)
